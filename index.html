	<h2><u>Why did I decide to study QA and automation?</u></h2>
	<div>
	<p>I come with a rich technical background and work in a computerized and diverse environment,
		<br>
		and for a long time i was looking for the right way and the right time to make a change,
		<br>
		and move to the high - tech field.
		<br>
		and after examining several subjects of high - tech I realized that QA speaks to me the most because the quality of the product for me is a very important part
		<br>
		
		of the process and its also important to me to provide the costumers a proper and high-quality product.
